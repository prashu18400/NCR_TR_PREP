# NCR_TR_PREP
Note: Prior to this round there was an online assessment conducted on HackerEarth platform, where we were 2 coding questioons to solve and MCq's based on aptitude, OOP's, Verbal
and SQL.Mostly concentrate on OOPs and SQL.Time duration was 1hr 40min

The two coding questions were

 1.CamelCase convention to Snakecase convention (20marks) - here we will be given some strings in Camel case convention and convert them to sankecase i.e output string should contain all lowercase letters....
 Ex : HackerEarth --> output : hacker_earth,
       macOS       --> output : mac_o_s
                                                              
 2. The other question was based on HashMap.  Here the main idea is to delete a number from an array such that it takes minimum steps to equalise the remaining elements
     present in the array . Here is an example problem for this (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-delete-operations-make-elements-array/)
